title: My 2024 Fitness Journey
---

I had my daughter late in life and want to be there for her as long as possible. I'm driven to live the healthiest life I can.

## Starting 2024 injured

In November of 2023 I was in a bicycle accident and broke my shoulder in two places. Recovery was complicated by a substandard  physical therapist who allowed complications to set in. When you hit your middle years certain conditions can cause [frozen shoulder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive_capsulitis_of_the_shoulder). In my case those conditions are:

- Inactivity and following through on correct exercises due to not being told what could happen if I didn't follow the regimin. I lifted weights, but didn't do the right movements
- A diabetic genetic pre-disposition on both sides
- I'm in my fifties.

So the frozen shoulder got really bad. For the first few months of the year the pain and immobility was intense. I got better thanks to a mix of Acupuncture, Tai Chi, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. My recovery pace was unusual, in that I had most of my mobility back within five months of the onset of the frozen shoulder.

## Taking up Tai Chi Once more

In university, I had taken Tai Chi and really liked the graceful movements and postures. However, at the same time I found other martial arts like Muay Thai and Filipino martial arts to be things that I enjoyed more. After my injury one of the exercises was recommended to me to help unlock the frozen shoulder was Tai Chi. Fortunately, London has a number of places that you can train. 

For a few months, I did Tai Chi under [James Drew](https://taiji-ap.co.uk/), and I found it both challenging and a lot of fun. However, time with family is my most precious commodity, and I had to choose between family and the evening Tai Chi classes. And family always wins.

## Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu

My wife suggested I attempt to return to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which had classes available in the early morning and lunchtimes. We agreed that if I could find a good coach, they might be able to assist me with managing my recovery. The reason is that as a combat sport, coaches need to know how to assist athletes with getting over injury in a safe way. To my great fortune, Mohammed Yusuf, the coach that I was able to train under while healing had a lot of experience in this regard.

As I got better, I trained more and more vigorously. By the month of May, I was able to free spar (fight) once more. 

Because my arms were capable of doing less, I had to focus on skill, core, and legs over straining arms. At first it was really hard but eventually I found a relaxed, slippery style that suited me.

In late November my effort saw the reward of my blue belt. I have mixed emotions, the belt is a nice milestone but it means I have a proverbial target around my waist. Since I often spar with people with whom I have 2x or 3x as many years, it means my game has to be correspondingly better.

## Cross-training with Audrey

One of the things I love about my wife Audrey is she likes to try out new things, including workout regimens. So, thanks to her, I got the chance to try many new exercise forms. In addition to the sense of exploration, new exercise patterns are always really hard, so it gave me a chance to really push myself and explore what I can do.  In no particular order we did:

- Reformer pilates
- Mat pilates
- Vinyasa yoga
- Yin yoga
- Hatha yoga
- Dance warmup exercise (they take all the dance warmup routines and make that a class)
- HIIT
- Various stationary bike classes
- General weightlifting classes to ensure technique is solid

## Weights

For the last few months of the year I've gotten into having two weight-training-to-failure sessions a week, with a focus on upper body. I'm enjoying having my strength back. However...

Amusingly, once I started getting my strength back for a few weeks my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu sparring really suffered. That's because I started to rely on my strength rather than my knowledge and skills. So, I would do things like:

- Attempt to out-strength my opponent, and they would just let me tire myself out on their defense
- Overpower one limb with my newfound strength, while they focused on position (would often take my back)

The fix for this is now right before I spar, I say this mantra: "play weak, play weak, play weak". 

## Diet

In general I eat meat, dairy, eggs, vegetables and a little citrus fuit. I avoid simple carbohydrates like breads, potato, rice, and sugars. Periodically I'll taste those things, as I've found completely denying myself of simple carbohydrates causes me to binge.

I supplement this vitamins, collagen, and creatine. The latter two help with my recovery. In addition to the muscular benefits I'm one of those people who get a cognitive boost from creatine. 

## Goals for 2025

- Continue with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
- Continue lifting weights
- Do 10 consecutive pullups
- Weight down to 77kg / 169.lbs
