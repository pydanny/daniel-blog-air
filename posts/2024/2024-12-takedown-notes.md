## Stance

* Inline like kendo stance, legs not too wide
* Not a high stance, lower like a coiled spring
* lead hand waist-height with palm up, back hand shoulder height
* Keep elbows in
* Move in shuffles, including pivots
* Not dissimilar to wrestling stance and move

## A takedown defense

One method of many

- When someone does a level change get in the habit of checking with lead hip
- Only works if stance is correct 
 
## Concepts

- Sticky foot is analogous to sticky hands
- Elbows in to maintain grips and defende counters
- Russian tie should use minimal movement, arm bar if possible

## Handfighting set

1. Opponent goes for collar tie
2. Up block to wrist grab
3. Inward arm bar on their elbow
4. Keep one hand on wrist
5. grab opposite hip
6. Lock both elbows in
7. If opponent resists by circling, let go hip and with other hand catch side of neck in cupped hand
8. Place foot outide theirs, use sticky foot 
to sweep
