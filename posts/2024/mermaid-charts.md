[MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org/) is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically. I've been a fan of tools like it (which includes [Graphviz]()) for years. 

Many thanks to [Imtiaz Khan](https://github.com/ImtiazKhanDS) for [the contribution](https://github.com/pydanny/daniel-blog-fasthtml/issues/8).
