    "In September of 2023 after a 5 year hiatus from creating new Python packages I decided to re-explore how to package Python code for distribution. This was before [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) existed so it was worth knowing all the nitty-gritty details. My sample project was [listo](https://github.com/pydanny/listo), an enhanced list for Python with these planned features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More consistent behavior . No more methods with \"in-place\" changes. Every method call returns a value\n",
    "- Added methods that are missing from the list type, like `.map()` and `.filter()`, which I never got around to implementing\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a fun little exploratory package. Alas, at the time my open source efforts went more towards [dj-notebook](https://github.com/pydanny/dj-notebook). Nevertheless I sometimes thought about revisiting and finishing the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I discovered `fastcore.foundation.L`. This handy sequence tool is similar in concept to my own `listo` but much more complete. Let's go over some of its features and compare it to the standard Python `list` structure."

The ability to convert a list comprehension like `[x for x in range(100)]` to a generator expression like `(x for x in range(100))` simply by converting square brackets to parenthesis is one of Python's greatest superpowers"
