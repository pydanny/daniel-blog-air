title: My Birthday Gift to You
---

My birthday is coming up on July 24th, and I'd like to celebrate by giving back. I can't thank you all enough for the incredible outpouring of support. But what I can do is give you a gift!

Starting on July 21st and ending sometime late on July 25th, you can download free copies of my dark fantasy novel, [Into the Brambles](https://mybook.to/itb) to your Kindle device or app.

### [Into the Brambles](https://mybook.to/itb)

It would mean a lot to me if you read my book. Honestly, every time someone tells me that they just finished reading [Into the Brambles](https://mybook.to/itb), it really makes my day.

Also, if you read it, please [write a review](https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&asin=B00VC5UQHO&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=133140011&ref_=cm_cr_dp_wrt_summary&store=digital-text#). ! It's a huge thrill whenever I see new reviews, even ones with honest, constructive criticism.
