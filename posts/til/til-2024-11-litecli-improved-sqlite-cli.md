Really useful shell for sqlite, I can't imagine going back to the native shell. 

Can be installed via:

```sh
pip install litecli
```

Usage:

```sh
litecli mydata.db
```

Enjoy the highlighting, text compleition, and more. If you are interested [go here to learn more about LiteCLI](https://litecli.com/).
