I'm excited to have learned there's a word for the count of arguments to a function/method/class: [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity). Throughout my career I would have called this any of the following:

- `number_of_args`
- `param_count`
- `numargs`
- `intArgumentCount`

Thanks to [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) for using it in a library or two and making me look up the word.
