*For those times when you want to avoid using the mouse to improve your desktop layout.*

First, open VS Code:

```
code my-project-dir/
```

Then, depending on your operating system, use these hotkeys:


## Mac OS X

Two versions of the same key combination:

```
⌃⌘F
```

```
control + command + F
```

## Windows and Linux:

```
F11
```
