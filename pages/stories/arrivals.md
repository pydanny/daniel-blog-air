description: An Amra story that's all a matter of perspective.

Amra navigated through the crowd with the agility of a skilled warrior. When the crowd grew too dense for that, he abandoned his agility and resorted to pushing his way through. He returned dirty looks with fierce scowls of determination. Finally, he reached the source of the commotion, where four burly sailors stood beside the large steel hatch leading out of the spaceship.

"Open the hatch," Amra ordered.

"We're waiting for the captain," replied the burliest sailor. "She needs to give each passenger a customs pre-check."

"You mean the captain wants to collect a bribe from each of us," Amra grumbled. The other passengers nodded in agreement.

"Now, now," the burliest sailor admonished. "That's not how things are done here. You can't say 'bribe' so blatantly. The term we prefer is 'undocumented exit fee.'"

"Open that hatch or..." Amra began.

"Or what?" countered the burliest sailor, drawing himself to full height and lifting a belaying pin. The other three sailors also straightened up, though they were not as tall or intimidating. "You want to take that back?"

"Why should I?" Amra replied, placing his hand on the hilt of his sword. The sword began to whisper dreadful things—not in a quiet library voice either. No, these were whispers that most people would describe as a shout. The volume of the whispering sword echoed in the steel corridor filled with dozens of other people.

After ten seconds of the whispering, Amra took his hand off his sword. "Are you going to open the hatch now, or do I need to do that again?" he asked the burliest sailor, who had been trying to scream over the sword's noise.

"No, no, mighty Amra," the burliest sailor said, gesturing with his belaying pin at the other sailors. "You heard the man; open the hatch!"

The other sailors scrambled to comply. Moments later, they had turned the wheel on the hatch and flung it open. The fresh air of Venus rushed into the ship.

On another planet, that fresh air would have been wonderful, but Venus was a swamp and jungle world. It was fetid and humid, thick with the smell of rotting vegetation and a hint of methane. The passengers shrank back from the hatch.

Not Amra. He strode down the gangplank as if he were king of the world. When he reached the ground, he walked confidently to the little customs booth and cheerfully tossed a few gold credits to the customs officers to bypass any tedious paperwork. He then moved past other spaceships to the exit gate of the spaceport.

Amra went through the gate, crossed the canal, and found himself in Aphrodite City. The buildings were a hodgepodge of salvaged materials, most of them losing the battle against the native tangle of vines climbing up their walls. He walked down streets covered with oddly sticky puddles. The bridges across canals were rickety and in need of repairs, and gangs of youth eyed him at every corner. It was smelly, dangerous, and not a suitable place for a healthy family.

But Amra felt right at home.

Like a man with a destiny, he made his way purposefully to a particular spot in Aphrodite City. This was the reason he had come. No other place in the Solar System could provide him what he desired. It was a rundown shack with a tin roof, one wall knocked out and replaced with a counter. Behind it, a grimy-looking old man leered at passing gang members, his grimace so foul that they hurried past him. He tended a brazier, where a small fire of stinkwood burned. 

"What do you want?" the old man asked as Amra approached.

"One lizard on a stick with three-year-old swamp sauce," Amra said.

The old man made a squelching sound with his lips before reaching down behind the counter and pulling out a plate of lizards already stuck onto sticks. He placed one on the brazier of burning stinkwood. As it began to sizzle, he basted it with swamp sauce. When the lizard was cooked, he handed the stick to Amra. "One gold credit," he said.

It was an exorbitant price for something so cheaply made, but Amra didn't care. He flipped the old man the gold credit and eagerly took his favorite food in hand. For a moment, he admired it with his eyes, ears, nose, and touch—even licking it to catch a hint of the flavor. "Perfection," Amra sighed deeply.

Suddenly, without warning, the air in the street wrinkled and twisted. It ripped open with a blinding flash of light. As Amra blinked away the stars from his eyes, he saw a dinosaur standing before him.

A tyrannosaurus rex, to be precise.

It wasn't one of those cheap dino copies—oversized lizards bred to resemble the thunder lizards from before time began. Instead, it had a beautiful coat of feathers and moved with a curious, alien grace, a striking combination of giant lizard and big cat. It wore a leather harness that held tools and gadgets.

"What year is it? Where am I?" the tyrannosaurus rex asked, its voice filled with wonder. Being as large as it was, however, its voice had a somewhat roaring quality.

"Um... you're in the year 2018, and you just arrived in Aphrodite City on the planet Venus," Amra replied.

Behind him, the old man had already shut shop. To be more accurate, he had fled—a wise precaution when dealing with such unexpected occurrences.
